# Library System (SFDX App)
Library system to track books and AV equipment that employees can borrow from a library.

* All library items, their type, and their current status are searchable/browsable in the system.
* The system prevent things like borrowing an item that has already been checked out.

# What I learned

* Using Salesforce's Lightning App Builder to create apps quicker in comparison to [Force.com](https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/products/force/?d=70130000000f27V&internal=true).
* Creating custom Objects, or at least custom fields on existing objects.
* Developing custom Lightning Web Components (HTML + Modern JavaScript), Apex code (backend controller).
